Yes — **what you’ve built is a valid microservice architecture**, and here's why:

### ✅ Why your setup qualifies as microservices:

* **Independent services**: You have `auth-service` and `game-service`, each in its **own container**, with its **own Dockerfile**.
* **Independent deployability**: They can be deployed separately.
* **Service-to-service communication**: `game-service` talks to `auth-service` over a network interface (e.g., HTTP or gRPC), **not directly to the DB**.
* **Encapsulation of data**: Only `auth-service` owns and accesses the database, preserving **data ownership** and **encapsulation** — this is a good practice.

### 🔍 Bonus note:

If `game-service` depends on `auth-service` for **data storage**, that’s OK — but it’s worth watching out for **tight coupling**. If one can't work without the other at all, it might be better to evaluate whether responsibilities are cleanly separated.

But overall:

> ✅ Yes — this is a **microservices design**. It might be **minimalist**, but it’s **correct in architecture**.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are **plain text files** that store data in a **structured format using key-value pairs**. They’re lightweight, easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

---

### ✅ Basic Structure of JSON

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

---

### 📌 Why JSON Files Are Used (Common Use Cases)

#### 1. **Configuration Files**

JSON is commonly used to store configuration data. Examples:

* `package.json` (for Node.js projects)
* `.eslintrc.json` (for ESLint configuration)
* `tsconfig.json` (for TypeScript compiler options)
* `docker-compose.override.json` (for Docker config overrides)

#### 2. **Data Exchange Format**

JSON is the **standard format** for APIs, especially RESTful APIs.

* When your frontend sends a request to the backend, it usually sends/receives JSON data.
* Example:

  ```json
  {
    "username": "shahria",
    "password": "123456"
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Dependency Management (like you mentioned)**

You're absolutely right — in environments like **Node.js**, the `package.json` file:

* Lists all dependencies and their versions.
* Ensures consistency across environments (e.g., all devs install the same versions).
* Paired with `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to **lock versions** and avoid unexpected updates.

### 📦 Key JSON Files in a Typical Project

| File                              | Purpose                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `package.json`                    | Project metadata + dependency list              |
| `package-lock.json`               | Locks down exact dependency versions            |
| `tsconfig.json`                   | Configures TypeScript behavior                  |
| `.babelrc` or `babel.config.json` | Configures Babel compiler                       |
| `manifest.json`                   | Metadata for web apps or browser extensions     |
| `db.json` (mock data)             | Often used in mock servers (like `json-server`) |

### 🧠 Summary

* **JSON** = structured, human-readable data format.
* Used for: configuration, APIs, storing settings/data, dependency management.
* Keeps things **consistent, shareable, and automatable** across projects.

You're **very close**! Let’s clarify the key terms and then give you the basic building blocks of a RESTful API.

---

### ⚙️ What is a RESTful API?

A **RESTful API** (Representational State Transfer) is a set of **rules** for how software systems should communicate over **HTTP**. It uses **URLs (endpoints)** to access and manipulate **resources** (usually data).

---

### ✅ Basic Concepts

| Term         | Meaning                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API**      | A set of defined rules for interacting with a system or app.                  |
| **REST**     | A style of API design that uses HTTP methods and URLs to access data.         |
| **Endpoint** | A specific URL + HTTP method that performs an operation on a resource.        |
| **Resource** | A piece of data or object (e.g., user, product, article) you're working with. |

> 🔸 You can think of an **API** as the whole system, while an **endpoint** is like one function or route in that system.

---

### 🛠 Basic RESTful API Actions

REST APIs revolve around **CRUD operations**:

| HTTP Method | Action         | Description               | Example Endpoint        |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `GET`       | Read           | Get a resource or list    | `/users` or `/users/42` |
| `POST`      | Create         | Add a new resource        | `/users`                |
| `PUT`       | Update         | Replace a resource        | `/users/42`             |
| `PATCH`     | Partial Update | Update part of a resource | `/users/42`             |
| `DELETE`    | Delete         | Remove a resource         | `/users/42`             |

---

### 🧩 Example: A Simple `users` API

Assume you're building a user system.

| Action           | Method | Endpoint   | What It Does            |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Get all users    | GET    | `/users`   | Returns a list of users |
| Get one user     | GET    | `/users/7` | Returns user with ID 7  |
| Create new user  | POST   | `/users`   | Creates a new user      |
| Update user info | PUT    | `/users/7` | Replaces user with ID 7 |
| Delete a user    | DELETE | `/users/7` | Deletes user with ID 7  |

---

### 🧠 Summary (Your Words vs. Clarified)

* ✅ You said: REST APIs are rules + a URL — **Correct!**
* ✅ You said: An API is a collection of these — **Yes, an API is the whole collection.**
* ✅ You said: An endpoint is one rule or URL — **Yes, an endpoint is a specific URL+method combo that does one thing.**

---

If you want, I can walk you through making a tiny REST API in Express (Node.js), Flask (Python), or even just with plain mock routes — just say the word.

Sure — here's a short, clear explanation:

---

### 🔐 What is **bcrypt**?

**`bcrypt`** is a **password hashing algorithm** used to **securely store passwords** in a database.

* It converts a password into a **hash** — a scrambled string that’s **very hard to reverse**.
* It's **slow by design**, making it resistant to brute-force attacks.

---

### 🧂 What is **bcrypt with salt**?

**Salt** is **random data added to a password** before hashing it.

* It ensures that **even if two people have the same password**, their hashes will look different.
* bcrypt **automatically generates and stores the salt** along with the hash.

---

### 🔁 Simple Flow:

1. User enters password: `"mypassword"`
2. bcrypt adds salt: `"mypassword+randomSalt"`
3. bcrypt hashes it: `"hashedString"`
4. Store only the **hashed string** in the database (never the real password)

---

### ✅ Why use bcrypt?

* **Prevents reverse-engineering passwords**
* **Prevents duplicate hashes for same passwords**
* **Built-in salting and work factor (adjustable security level)**

Let me know if you want to see a code example in Node.js or Python.

Absolutely — here’s a short, crystal-clear breakdown to help you **truly understand SQL Injection** and how protection works:

---

## 🔓 What is **SQL Injection**?

**SQL Injection** happens when a hacker sends **malicious SQL code** as input to trick your application into running **unauthorized queries**.

### 💥 Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine a login form asking:

```
What's your email?
```

And someone types:

```
'; DROP TABLE users; --
```

If your code **blindly adds that input into your SQL**, it becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ''; DROP TABLE users; --
```

☠️ That `DROP TABLE` command **deletes your entire user table**. That's SQL injection.

---

## 🧠 Why Does It Happen?

Because you're **mixing user input with SQL code**, like this:

```ts
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;
```

If `email` contains SQL code, it **gets executed**.

---

## 🛡️ How Do You Prevent It?

### ✅ 1. **Prepared Statements** (MAIN defense)

You use placeholders `?` instead of injecting raw values:

```ts
db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [email]);
```

Now even if `email = "'; DROP TABLE users; --"`, it is treated as a **string**, not a command.

> 🧱 **Think of it as building a wall between your SQL and the user's input.**

---

### ✅ 2. **Input Validation** (Secondary defense)

You check that data **looks correct** before using it:

```ts
const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(6)
});
```

Even if the user tries to be sneaky, bad input gets **rejected early**.

---

### ✅ 3. **Type Safety**

TypeScript ensures that, for example, `userId` is a number, not a string or malicious input.

```ts
function updateStats(userId: number) {
  // Only accepts a valid number
}
```

---

## 🧪 What SQL Injection Tries to Do:

| Attack Type      | What Hacker Tries | Example Input                       | Effect (If Not Protected) |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Bypass Login** | Trick query       | `' OR 1=1 --`                       | Logs in as any user       |
| **Drop Tables**  | Delete data       | `'; DROP TABLE users; --`           | Deletes all user data     |
| **Steal Data**   | Union attack      | `'; UNION SELECT * FROM secrets --` | Returns hidden data       |

---

## ✅ Final Summary for You

> **SQL Injection happens when user input is executed as SQL code.**
>
> 🔒 To prevent it:
>
> * Use **prepared statements** (so input is treated as data, not code)
> * Validate input (like checking it's a real email)
> * Rely on type safety (like making sure IDs are numbers)
>
> These layers together make your app **resistant to all known SQL injection techniques**.

Absolutely! Here's a **simple breakdown of the main types of SQL Injection**, explained in plain English — no fluff, just clarity:

---

## 🧨 1. **Classic (In-band) SQL Injection**

This is the **most common** kind.

### 🔧 How it works:

The attacker sends bad SQL directly in the input, and **gets results right away** in the response.

### 💡 Example:

```sql
' OR 1=1 --
```

This makes a query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --';
```

Result: **Bypasses login** because `1=1` is always true.

---

## 🕵️ 2. **Blind SQL Injection**

The app **doesn’t show results**, but the attacker guesses what’s happening based on **yes/no behavior**.

### 🧪 Two types:

#### ✅ Boolean-Based:

They try different inputs and observe **true/false** results.

Example:

```sql
' AND 1=1 --   ✅ (Page loads normally)
' AND 1=2 --   ❌ (Error or different page)
```

#### ⏱️ Time-Based:

They use SQL functions to **delay** the response if a condition is true.

Example:

```sql
' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0) --
```

If page takes longer → they know the condition was true.

---

## 🔁 3. **Union-Based SQL Injection**

Used to **steal data from other tables** by combining results.

### 💡 Example:

```sql
' UNION SELECT credit_card_number, 1 FROM payments --
```

If the app shows results, attacker sees **sensitive data**.

---

## 📦 4. **Stored (Persistent) SQL Injection**

Bad SQL is **saved in the database**, then executed later when someone views it.

### 🧨 Example:

A user signs up with this name:

```
Robert'); DROP TABLE users; --
```

If the app later runs this name in a SQL query, **boom** — the attack runs.

---

## 🧬 5. **Out-of-Band SQL Injection** (Rare)

Instead of getting results on the same page, the attacker uses **network tricks** (like DNS requests) to exfiltrate data.

### ⚠️ When this happens:

* App **doesn’t return results**
* But attacker has control over a **server** to receive data

| Type            | What Happens                           | Used For                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Classic**     | Inject & get results directly          | Login bypass, data theft  |
| **Blind**       | No output, use true/false or timing    | Slow but stealthy attacks |
| **Union-based** | Combines queries to extract data       | Steal from other tables   |
| **Stored**      | Injected code is saved & runs later    | Hits all who see the data |
| **Out-of-band** | Sends stolen data to attacker's server | Rare but powerful         |
