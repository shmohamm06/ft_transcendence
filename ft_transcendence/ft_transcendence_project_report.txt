Section 2: Introduction
ft_transcendence is a web-based reimagining of the classic Pong game, enhanced with modern features such as real-time multiplayer, secure authentication, and user management. The project was developed as a collaborative effort by a five-member team, each contributing their expertise in backend, frontend, or game development. The primary objective was to deliver a robust, scalable, and engaging gaming platform that demonstrates the application of software engineering principles in a real-world context. This report outlines the journey from initial concept to final delivery, detailing the processes, challenges, and solutions encountered along the way.


Section 2.1: Modules Implemented
To achieve 100% project completion, our team focused on the following major and minor modules, as required by the project subject:

Web:
- Major: Used Fastify (Node.js) to build the backend as a robust, scalable API service.
- Minor: Used React and TypeScript to build a modern, responsive frontend.
- Minor: Integrated SQLite as the backend database for persistent storage.

User Management:
- Major: Implemented standard user management, including registration, authentication (JWT), and user tracking across tournaments and games.

Gameplay and User Experience:
- Major: Developed multiplayer support, allowing more than two players in the same game session.
- Major: Added a second game (Tic-Tac-Toe) with user history and basic matchmaking.
- Minor: Provided game customization options (e.g., paddle/ball speed, color themes).

AI-Algo:
- Major: Introduced an AI opponent for single-player Pong and Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Minor: Built user and game stats dashboards for performance tracking.

DevOps:
- Major: Designed the backend as microservices, with separate services for authentication and game logic, orchestrated via Docker Compose.

Accessibility:
- Minor: Expanded browser compatibility, ensuring the platform works on all major browsers.

Section 3: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Our team adopted an Agile SDLC, organizing the project into iterative sprints with regular stand-ups and continuous integration. The phases included planning, requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Each phase was documented and reviewed to ensure alignment with project goals and requirements. Collaboration was facilitated through version control, code reviews, and issue tracking, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the development process.

3.1 Project Initiation and Planning
The project began with a kickoff meeting to define objectives, deliverables, and team roles. Each member was assigned responsibilities based on their expertise: Shahria Shadman Mohammed and Fahad Maqdasi (Backend), Wahab Yaseen and Aleksei Bobylev (Frontend), and Temirlan Zhakypov (Game). We established communication channels, selected tools (GitHub, Slack, Trello), and set up a shared repository.

3.2 Requirement Analysis
We conducted requirement gathering sessions, referencing the official project requirements and brainstorming additional features. Functional and technical requirements were documented and prioritized. Use cases and user stories were developed to guide implementation.

3.3 Design
The team created wireframes, flowcharts, and an initial database schema. Architectural decisions were made collaboratively, with a focus on modularity, scalability, and security. The system was divided into backend, frontend, and game engine components, each with clear interfaces and responsibilities.

3.4 Implementation (Sprints)
Development was organized into sprints, each focused on a specific set of features:
- Sprint 1: User registration and authentication (JWT, password hashing)
- Sprint 2: Multiplayer Pong gameplay (WebSocket integration)
- Sprint 3: Game customization options and stats dashboards
- Sprint 4: Second game (Tic-Tac-Toe) with basic matchmaking
- Sprint 5: AI opponent for both games
- Sprint 6: Microservices and Dockerization
- Sprint 7: Browser compatibility and UI polish
Each sprint included daily stand-ups, code reviews, and testing.

3.5 Testing and Quality Assurance
Testing was integrated throughout development. Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests were written for backend and frontend components. Manual testing was performed for gameplay and UI/UX. Bugs were tracked and resolved using GitHub Issues. Security testing included validation against SQL injection, XSS, and authentication bypass.

3.6 Deployment and Evolution
The application was containerized using Docker and deployed to a cloud environment. CI/CD pipelines automated testing and deployment. The team conducted retrospectives after each sprint to identify improvements and adapt to changing requirements. Future enhancements were documented for post-project development.

Section 5: Design
5.1 System Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture, with a clear separation between frontend, backend, and game engine. The backend exposes REST and WebSocket APIs for data and real-time events. The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript. The game engine runs in the browser, using Canvas/WebGL for rendering and custom logic for physics and input handling.

5.4 Security Design
Security is integrated at every layer: password hashing (bcrypt), JWT for session management, HTTPS for all traffic, input validation on both client and server, and 2FA for sensitive actions. Rate limiting and logging are implemented to detect and prevent abuse.

5.5 API and Integration
RESTful APIs are used for user management, matchmaking, and leaderboards. WebSocket APIs handle real-time gameplay and chat. The frontend consumes these APIs via async actions and manages state with Redux.

5.6 Deployment Architecture
The application is containerized with Docker, using Docker Compose to orchestrate backend, frontend, and database services. Environment variables and secrets are managed securely. CI/CD pipelines automate build, test, and deployment steps.
