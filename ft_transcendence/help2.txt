Yes — **what you’ve built is a valid microservice architecture**, and here's why:

### ✅ Why your setup qualifies as microservices:

* **Independent services**: You have `auth-service` and `game-service`, each in its **own container**, with its **own Dockerfile**.
* **Independent deployability**: They can be deployed separately.
* **Service-to-service communication**: `game-service` talks to `auth-service` over a network interface (e.g., HTTP or gRPC), **not directly to the DB**.
* **Encapsulation of data**: Only `auth-service` owns and accesses the database, preserving **data ownership** and **encapsulation** — this is a good practice.

### 🔍 Bonus note:

If `game-service` depends on `auth-service` for **data storage**, that’s OK — but it’s worth watching out for **tight coupling**. If one can't work without the other at all, it might be better to evaluate whether responsibilities are cleanly separated.

But overall:

> ✅ Yes — this is a **microservices design**. It might be **minimalist**, but it’s **correct in architecture**.

Let me know if you want a checklist or suggestions to make it more robust.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are **plain text files** that store data in a **structured format using key-value pairs**. They’re lightweight, easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

---

### ✅ Basic Structure of JSON

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

---

### 📌 Why JSON Files Are Used (Common Use Cases)

#### 1. **Configuration Files**

JSON is commonly used to store configuration data. Examples:

* `package.json` (for Node.js projects)
* `.eslintrc.json` (for ESLint configuration)
* `tsconfig.json` (for TypeScript compiler options)
* `docker-compose.override.json` (for Docker config overrides)

#### 2. **Data Exchange Format**

JSON is the **standard format** for APIs, especially RESTful APIs.

* When your frontend sends a request to the backend, it usually sends/receives JSON data.
* Example:

  ```json
  {
    "username": "shahria",
    "password": "123456"
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Dependency Management (like you mentioned)**

You're absolutely right — in environments like **Node.js**, the `package.json` file:

* Lists all dependencies and their versions.
* Ensures consistency across environments (e.g., all devs install the same versions).
* Paired with `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to **lock versions** and avoid unexpected updates.

---

### 📦 Key JSON Files in a Typical Project

| File                              | Purpose                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `package.json`                    | Project metadata + dependency list              |
| `package-lock.json`               | Locks down exact dependency versions            |
| `tsconfig.json`                   | Configures TypeScript behavior                  |
| `.babelrc` or `babel.config.json` | Configures Babel compiler                       |
| `manifest.json`                   | Metadata for web apps or browser extensions     |
| `db.json` (mock data)             | Often used in mock servers (like `json-server`) |

---

### 🧠 Summary

* **JSON** = structured, human-readable data format.
* Used for: configuration, APIs, storing settings/data, dependency management.
* Keeps things **consistent, shareable, and automatable** across projects.

Let me know if you want to dive into a specific JSON file (e.g., `package.json`) in detail.

You're **very close**! Let’s clarify the key terms and then give you the basic building blocks of a RESTful API.

---

### ⚙️ What is a RESTful API?

A **RESTful API** (Representational State Transfer) is a set of **rules** for how software systems should communicate over **HTTP**. It uses **URLs (endpoints)** to access and manipulate **resources** (usually data).

---

### ✅ Basic Concepts

| Term         | Meaning                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API**      | A set of defined rules for interacting with a system or app.                  |
| **REST**     | A style of API design that uses HTTP methods and URLs to access data.         |
| **Endpoint** | A specific URL + HTTP method that performs an operation on a resource.        |
| **Resource** | A piece of data or object (e.g., user, product, article) you're working with. |

> 🔸 You can think of an **API** as the whole system, while an **endpoint** is like one function or route in that system.

---

### 🛠 Basic RESTful API Actions

REST APIs revolve around **CRUD operations**:

| HTTP Method | Action         | Description               | Example Endpoint        |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `GET`       | Read           | Get a resource or list    | `/users` or `/users/42` |
| `POST`      | Create         | Add a new resource        | `/users`                |
| `PUT`       | Update         | Replace a resource        | `/users/42`             |
| `PATCH`     | Partial Update | Update part of a resource | `/users/42`             |
| `DELETE`    | Delete         | Remove a resource         | `/users/42`             |

---

### 🧩 Example: A Simple `users` API

Assume you're building a user system.

| Action           | Method | Endpoint   | What It Does            |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Get all users    | GET    | `/users`   | Returns a list of users |
| Get one user     | GET    | `/users/7` | Returns user with ID 7  |
| Create new user  | POST   | `/users`   | Creates a new user      |
| Update user info | PUT    | `/users/7` | Replaces user with ID 7 |
| Delete a user    | DELETE | `/users/7` | Deletes user with ID 7  |

---

### 🧠 Summary (Your Words vs. Clarified)

* ✅ You said: REST APIs are rules + a URL — **Correct!**
* ✅ You said: An API is a collection of these — **Yes, an API is the whole collection.**
* ✅ You said: An endpoint is one rule or URL — **Yes, an endpoint is a specific URL+method combo that does one thing.**

---

If you want, I can walk you through making a tiny REST API in Express (Node.js), Flask (Python), or even just with plain mock routes — just say the word.

Sure — here's a short, clear explanation:

---

### 🔐 What is **bcrypt**?

**`bcrypt`** is a **password hashing algorithm** used to **securely store passwords** in a database.

* It converts a password into a **hash** — a scrambled string that’s **very hard to reverse**.
* It's **slow by design**, making it resistant to brute-force attacks.

---

### 🧂 What is **bcrypt with salt**?

**Salt** is **random data added to a password** before hashing it.

* It ensures that **even if two people have the same password**, their hashes will look different.
* bcrypt **automatically generates and stores the salt** along with the hash.

---

### 🔁 Simple Flow:

1. User enters password: `"mypassword"`
2. bcrypt adds salt: `"mypassword+randomSalt"`
3. bcrypt hashes it: `"hashedString"`
4. Store only the **hashed string** in the database (never the real password)

---

### ✅ Why use bcrypt?

* **Prevents reverse-engineering passwords**
* **Prevents duplicate hashes for same passwords**
* **Built-in salting and work factor (adjustable security level)**

Let me know if you want to see a code example in Node.js or Python.

Absolutely — here’s a short, crystal-clear breakdown to help you **truly understand SQL Injection** and how protection works:

---

## 🔓 What is **SQL Injection**?

**SQL Injection** happens when a hacker sends **malicious SQL code** as input to trick your application into running **unauthorized queries**.

### 💥 Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine a login form asking:

```
What's your email?
```

And someone types:

```
'; DROP TABLE users; --
```

If your code **blindly adds that input into your SQL**, it becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ''; DROP TABLE users; --
```

☠️ That `DROP TABLE` command **deletes your entire user table**. That's SQL injection.

---

## 🧠 Why Does It Happen?

Because you're **mixing user input with SQL code**, like this:

```ts
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;
```

If `email` contains SQL code, it **gets executed**.

---

## 🛡️ How Do You Prevent It?

### ✅ 1. **Prepared Statements** (MAIN defense)

You use placeholders `?` instead of injecting raw values:

```ts
db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [email]);
```

Now even if `email = "'; DROP TABLE users; --"`, it is treated as a **string**, not a command.

> 🧱 **Think of it as building a wall between your SQL and the user's input.**

---

### ✅ 2. **Input Validation** (Secondary defense)

You check that data **looks correct** before using it:

```ts
const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(6)
});
```

Even if the user tries to be sneaky, bad input gets **rejected early**.

---

### ✅ 3. **Type Safety**

TypeScript ensures that, for example, `userId` is a number, not a string or malicious input.

```ts
function updateStats(userId: number) {
  // Only accepts a valid number
}
```

---

## 🧪 What SQL Injection Tries to Do:

| Attack Type      | What Hacker Tries | Example Input                       | Effect (If Not Protected) |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Bypass Login** | Trick query       | `' OR 1=1 --`                       | Logs in as any user       |
| **Drop Tables**  | Delete data       | `'; DROP TABLE users; --`           | Deletes all user data     |
| **Steal Data**   | Union attack      | `'; UNION SELECT * FROM secrets --` | Returns hidden data       |

---

## ✅ Final Summary for You

> **SQL Injection happens when user input is executed as SQL code.**
>
> 🔒 To prevent it:
>
> * Use **prepared statements** (so input is treated as data, not code)
> * Validate input (like checking it's a real email)
> * Rely on type safety (like making sure IDs are numbers)
>
> These layers together make your app **resistant to all known SQL injection techniques**.

---

Absolutely! Here's a **simple breakdown of the main types of SQL Injection**, explained in plain English — no fluff, just clarity:

---

## 🧨 1. **Classic (In-band) SQL Injection**

This is the **most common** kind.

### 🔧 How it works:

The attacker sends bad SQL directly in the input, and **gets results right away** in the response.

### 💡 Example:

```sql
' OR 1=1 --
```

This makes a query like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --';
```

Result: **Bypasses login** because `1=1` is always true.

---

## 🕵️ 2. **Blind SQL Injection**

The app **doesn’t show results**, but the attacker guesses what’s happening based on **yes/no behavior**.

### 🧪 Two types:

#### ✅ Boolean-Based:

They try different inputs and observe **true/false** results.

Example:

```sql
' AND 1=1 --   ✅ (Page loads normally)
' AND 1=2 --   ❌ (Error or different page)
```

#### ⏱️ Time-Based:

They use SQL functions to **delay** the response if a condition is true.

Example:

```sql
' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0) --
```

If page takes longer → they know the condition was true.

---

## 🔁 3. **Union-Based SQL Injection**

Used to **steal data from other tables** by combining results.

### 💡 Example:

```sql
' UNION SELECT credit_card_number, 1 FROM payments --
```

If the app shows results, attacker sees **sensitive data**.

---

## 📦 4. **Stored (Persistent) SQL Injection**

Bad SQL is **saved in the database**, then executed later when someone views it.

### 🧨 Example:

A user signs up with this name:

```
Robert'); DROP TABLE users; --
```

If the app later runs this name in a SQL query, **boom** — the attack runs.

---

## 🧬 5. **Out-of-Band SQL Injection** (Rare)

Instead of getting results on the same page, the attacker uses **network tricks** (like DNS requests) to exfiltrate data.

### ⚠️ When this happens:

* App **doesn’t return results**
* But attacker has control over a **server** to receive data

---

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Type            | What Happens                           | Used For                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Classic**     | Inject & get results directly          | Login bypass, data theft  |
| **Blind**       | No output, use true/false or timing    | Slow but stealthy attacks |
| **Union-based** | Combines queries to extract data       | Steal from other tables   |
| **Stored**      | Injected code is saved & runs later    | Hits all who see the data |
| **Out-of-band** | Sends stolen data to attacker's server | Rare but powerful         |

# 12 Strategic Questions for Your Backend Evaluation

Here are 12 questions that sound complex but are actually straightforward to answer, designed to showcase your backend knowledge:

## **1. Database Architecture & Security**
**"Can you explain our database normalization strategy and how we prevent SQL injection attacks in our user authentication system?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use a three-table normalized design: users (core data), user_stats (game statistics), and game_settings (user preferences). For SQL injection prevention, we exclusively use prepared statements with parameterized queries, ensuring user input is treated as data rather than executable SQL code."

## **2. Authentication & Authorization**
**"How does our JWT token system work, and what security measures have we implemented to protect user sessions?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use stateless JWT authentication where tokens contain encrypted user data. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt using salt, and tokens are verified on each protected route. We also implement CORS to control cross-origin access."

## **3. Microservices Communication**
**"Can you walk me through how our auth-service and game-service communicate, and what design patterns we used for inter-service data exchange?"**

*Your Answer:* "Our game-service communicates with auth-service via HTTP REST APIs for user settings and token verification. We maintain service independence while sharing necessary data through well-defined API contracts."

## **4. Real-time Communication**
**"How did we implement real-time game state synchronization, and what considerations went into choosing WebSocket over HTTP polling?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use WebSocket connections for real-time game updates at 60 FPS. This eliminates polling overhead and provides immediate bidirectional communication, essential for responsive gaming experience."

## **5. Error Handling & Resilience**
**"What's our approach to error handling across different layers of the backend, and how do we ensure graceful degradation when services fail?"**

*Your Answer:* "We implement comprehensive error handling with specific HTTP status codes, database constraint error handling, and structured logging. Each service can operate independently with proper fallback mechanisms."

## **6. Data Integrity & Transactions**
**"How do we maintain data consistency across our database operations, especially when creating users and their associated statistics?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use database transactions to ensure atomic operations. When a user registers, both the user record and their stats record are created in a single transaction, with rollback on failure."

## **7. API Design & REST Principles**
**"Can you explain our RESTful API design patterns and how we handle different HTTP methods for user resource management?"**

*Your Answer:* "We follow REST principles with resource-based URLs. POST for creation (/api/users/register), GET for retrieval (/api/users/profile), PUT for updates (/api/settings), with proper status codes and response formats."

## **8. Performance & Scalability**
**"What performance optimizations have we implemented, and how does our architecture support horizontal scaling?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use prepared statements for database performance, efficient JOIN queries, and stateless design for horizontal scaling. Our microservices architecture allows independent scaling of auth and game services."

## **9. Security Best Practices**
**"What security layers have we implemented beyond basic authentication, and how do we protect against common web vulnerabilities?"**

*Your Answer:* "Beyond JWT authentication, we implement input validation with Zod schemas, CORS protection, password hashing with bcrypt, and prepared statements for SQL injection prevention."

## **10. Database Schema Design**
**"Can you explain our database schema relationships and how we handle foreign key constraints for data integrity?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use proper foreign key relationships with CASCADE deletes. The users table is the primary entity, with user_stats (one-to-one) and game_settings (one-to-many) properly linked via user_id foreign keys."

## **11. Service Architecture**
**"How did we achieve service separation in our microservices architecture, and what are the benefits of this design pattern?"**

*Your Answer:* "We separated concerns: auth-service handles user management and authentication, while game-service manages real-time game logic. This provides independent deployment, technology flexibility, and fault isolation."

## **12. Development & Deployment**
**"What's our development workflow and how do we ensure consistent environments from development to production?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use Docker containerization for consistent environments, environment variables for configuration, and TypeScript for type safety. Each service has its own container with proper port mapping and service discovery."

## **Key Points to Emphasize:**

- **Technical depth** - Show understanding of underlying concepts
- **Security awareness** - Demonstrate knowledge of best practices
- **Architecture decisions** - Explain why you chose specific patterns
- **Problem-solving** - Show how you handle real-world challenges
- **Scalability thinking** - Demonstrate forward-looking design

# 4 Additional Strategic Questions (Non-DB/Game Focus)

Here are 4 more questions that focus on other backend aspects to showcase your broader knowledge:

## **13. API Gateway & Routing**
**"How did we implement our API gateway pattern with Nginx, and what considerations went into designing our reverse proxy configuration?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use Nginx as a reverse proxy to route requests to appropriate services. It handles CORS, load balancing, and provides a single entry point. The gateway routes /api/* to auth-service and /ws/game to game-service, creating a clean separation of concerns."

## **14. Environment Management & Configuration**
**"Can you explain our environment configuration strategy and how we handle different deployment environments from development to production?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use environment variables for configuration management. Development uses localhost ports and SQLite, while production would use environment-specific databases and secrets. We use dotenv for local development and Docker environment variables for containerized deployment."

## **15. Code Quality & Type Safety**
**"What's our approach to maintaining code quality and type safety across our backend services, and how does this impact our development workflow?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use TypeScript for static type checking, Zod for runtime validation, and structured error handling. This catches bugs early, provides better IDE support, and ensures API contracts are properly enforced between services."

## **16. Testing Strategy & Quality Assurance**
**"How do we approach testing in our backend architecture, and what testing strategies have we implemented to ensure reliability?"**

*Your Answer:* "We implement unit testing for business logic, integration testing for API endpoints, and use TypeScript for compile-time error checking. Our stateless design makes services easily testable, and we use prepared statements which are inherently testable."

---

## **Bonus: Technical Deep-Dive Questions**

### **17. CORS & Security Headers**
**"Can you explain our CORS configuration and how we handle cross-origin requests between our frontend and backend services?"**

*Your Answer:* "We configure CORS to allow specific origins (localhost:8081, localhost:3000) and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). This prevents unauthorized cross-origin access while enabling our frontend to communicate with our backend APIs."

### **18. Error Logging & Monitoring**
**"What's our logging strategy and how do we handle error tracking across distributed services?"**

*Your Answer:* "We use structured logging with Fastify's built-in logger, capturing request/response data and error details. Each service logs independently, and we can aggregate logs for debugging distributed issues."
